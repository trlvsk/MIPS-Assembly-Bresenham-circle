# MIPS-Assembly-Bresenham-circle
A code that draws circle of given radius at any given point of the file on given .BMP file
It is MIPS ASeembly project done for my subject ECOAR (Computer Architecture) studdied in WUT EITI

Code as it stands on the repository is set for the 512x512 bmp file

which can be easilly changed for one of your choice by setting a max_file_size in line 12

in terms of collors 
0 - black pixel
1 - white pixel

Make sure u set correct ini and result file names before executing and they are in the same path!

Drawing is robust against drawing circle out of the file borders but will not run propperly if you set a centrepoint outside the file
